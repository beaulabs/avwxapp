# avwxapp

AVWXAPP is a small weather app to pull aviation related weather information and forecasts from both METARs and TAFs.
It is intended to be used for demo purposes with MongoDB Atlas and related features such as Charts, Realm Triggers/Functions
as well as to showcase sharding capababilities including zoned/data locality.
